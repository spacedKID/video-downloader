## üíª Installation & Use (macOS)

This project uses [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv), a modern, Rust-based Python package and environment manager.

### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/video-downloader.git
cd video-downloader
```

### 2. üì¶ Set up the environment with uv
Create and activate a virtual environment for the project. Then install the package as a shell command.

```uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install pip  # ensures pip is available
uv pip install --uv-lock uv.lock
pip install -e .
```

### 3. üöÄ Usage
`video-downloader path/to/urls.csv`

### Feature: üìÅ Logs

Each run creates a timestamped log file at:

`~/Library/Logs/video-downloader/video_downloader_YYYY-MM-DD_HHMMSS.log`


### Optional: üì¶ Dependencies
(This step is only required should you install additional software and need to update the repository.)

Dependencies are listed in `pyproject.toml` and fully locked in `uv.lock`.

To update the lockfile after changing dependencies:

`uv pip compile pyproject.toml > uv.lock`

### üîê Optional: Login-Protected Videos

If a video requires authentication, place your cookies export at:

`~/cookies.txt`

The tool will automatically retry failed downloads using this file when login is required.

Note: ive used a firefox add-on called [Cookies.txt](https://github.com/hrdl-github/cookies-txt) to obtain a copy of my browser cookies.
